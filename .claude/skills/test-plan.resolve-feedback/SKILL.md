# Test Plan Feedback Resolver

Read review comments from a GitHub PR, assess each one against the existing test plan, let the user decide which to apply, make the changes, and push updates to the same branch.

## Usage

```
/test-plan.resolve-feedback <PR_URL>
```

Examples:
- `/test-plan.resolve-feedback https://github.com/org/test-plans-repo/pull/42`

## Inputs

### From arguments
Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract:
1. **First argument** (required): Full GitHub PR URL (e.g., `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<number>`)

Parse the URL to extract `owner`, `repo`, and `PR_NUMBER`.

### Interactive fallback
If no PR URL is provided, ask the user for it via AskUserQuestion.

## Process

### Step 0: Pre-flight Checks

#### 0.1 GitHub CLI
Run `gh auth status` via Bash. If it fails, inform the user that `gh` CLI must be installed and authenticated. Do NOT proceed until this succeeds.

#### 0.2 Validate PR exists
Fetch PR metadata:
```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json number,title,state,headRefName,body
```
If the PR does not exist or is closed/merged, inform the user and stop.

#### 0.3 Clone or fetch the repo
If the current working directory is not the target repo, clone it:
```bash
gh repo clone <owner>/<repo> /tmp/<repo>
cd /tmp/<repo>
```
If it is the target repo, just fetch:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

#### 0.4 Switch to PR branch
Check out the PR branch locally:
```bash
git checkout <head_branch>
```

#### 0.5 Locate feature directory
Find the feature directory by looking for `TestPlan.md` on the branch:
```bash
find . -name "TestPlan.md" -not -path "./.claude/*"
```
If multiple feature directories are found, ask the user which one to use via AskUserQuestion.

#### 0.6 Validate frontmatter
Run `uv run python scripts/frontmatter.py validate <feature_dir>/TestPlan.md` via Bash. If validation fails, show the errors — these will need to be fixed as part of the feedback resolution.

### Step 1: Collect Review Comments

1. Fetch conversation comments and formal reviews in one call:
   ```bash
   gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json comments,reviews
   ```

2. Fetch inline review comments (comments on specific lines/files):
   ```bash
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments
   ```

3. Parse and build a list of all comments with:
   - **Who**: reviewer username
   - **Where**: general, or specific file + line
   - **What**: the comment body

4. Filter out:
   - Bot comments
   - Purely conversational comments (e.g., "looks good", "thanks", "LGTM")
   - Already-resolved review threads (if resolution status is available)

If no actionable comments remain, inform the user and stop.

### Step 2: Read the Test Plan

Read `<feature_dir>/TestPlan.md` using the Read tool. This is needed to assess each comment against what the plan currently says.

If `TestPlanGaps.md` exists, read it too — some feedback may relate to known gaps.

### Step 3: Assess and Present Feedback

For each actionable comment, **assess it** against the existing test plan content and present your assessment to the user. Process comments one at a time (or in small related groups) via AskUserQuestion.

For each comment, present:

> **Feedback #<N>** — @<reviewer>
> **File**: <file> (line <line>, if inline)
>
> > <quoted reviewer comment>
>
> **Assessment**: <your analysis>
>
> Explain whether the feedback:
> - **Aligns** with the strategy and test plan — the reviewer is pointing out a genuine gap or issue
> - **Conflicts** with existing content — the reviewer may be suggesting something that contradicts the strategy scope or is explicitly out-of-scope
> - **Needs clarification** — the comment is ambiguous and you cannot determine the right change without more context
> - **Is already covered** — what the reviewer is asking for already exists in the plan (point to the specific section)
>
> If the feedback aligns, describe the **concrete change** you would make (which file, which section, what edit).
>
> **Action?**
> 1. **Apply** — make the suggested change
> 2. **Skip** — do not apply this feedback
> 3. **Discuss** — you want to provide more context before deciding

If the user chooses **Discuss**, engage in conversation about the feedback item, then re-present the action choice.

Keep a running tally of applied vs skipped items.

### Step 4: Apply Accepted Changes

For each accepted feedback item, apply the change:

- Use the Edit tool to modify `TestPlan.md`, `TestPlanGaps.md`, or `test_cases/TC-*.md`
- For frontmatter changes, use `uv run python scripts/frontmatter.py set` to ensure validation
- If a change affects test cases:
  - Update existing `TC-*.md` files as needed
  - Update `test_cases/INDEX.md` if test cases were added, removed, or re-prioritized
  - Update TestPlan.md Sections 5 and 8 to reflect changes

### Step 5: Update Frontmatter

After all changes are applied:

1. Bump the `version` patch number (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`):
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/frontmatter.py set <feature_dir>/TestPlan.md version="<new_version>"
   ```

2. Keep `status` as `In Review`

3. If gaps were resolved by the feedback, update `TestPlanGaps.md`:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/frontmatter.py set <feature_dir>/TestPlanGaps.md gap_count=<new_count>
   ```
   If all gaps resolved, set `status=Resolved`.

### Step 6: Validate

Run validation on all modified artifacts:
```bash
uv run python scripts/frontmatter.py validate <feature_dir>/TestPlan.md
```

If test cases were modified:
```bash
for f in <feature_dir>/test_cases/TC-*.md; do
    uv run python scripts/frontmatter.py validate "$f"
done
```

If any validation fails, fix the issue before proceeding.

### Step 7: Commit and Push

1. Present the final summary of changes to the user via AskUserQuestion before committing:
   > **Ready to push changes**
   >
   > - **Applied**: <N> of <total> feedback items
   > - **Skipped**: <M> items
   > - **Version**: `<old_version>` → `<new_version>`
   > - **Files modified**:
   >   - <list of changed files>
   >
   > Push to branch `<head_branch>`? (yes/no)

   If the user declines, leave the changes uncommitted and stop.

2. Stage all changes:
   ```bash
   git add <feature_dir>/
   ```

3. Commit with a descriptive message that summarizes the actual changes applied, not just "resolve feedback". Use a heredoc to avoid shell injection from frontmatter values:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   test-plan(<strat_key>): <short summary of changes> (PR #<PR_NUMBER>)
   EOF
   )"
   ```
   Examples:
   - `test-plan(RHAISTRAT-400): add rollback test coverage, fix P0 priority definitions (PR #5)`
   - `test-plan(RHAISTRAT-1262): clarify scope boundaries, add missing DB endpoints (PR #12)`
   - `test-plan(RHAISTRAT-400): rewrite risk section per reviewer feedback (PR #5)`

   Generate the summary from the list of applied feedback items. Keep it concise — highlight the 2-3 most significant changes.

4. Push to the same branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin <head_branch>
   ```

### Step 8: Confirm

1. Display a summary:
   > **Feedback resolved successfully**
   >
   > - **PR**: #<PR_NUMBER>
   > - **Branch**: `<head_branch>`
   > - **Version**: `<old_version>` → `<new_version>`
   > - **Applied**: <N> feedback items
   > - **Skipped**: <M> feedback items
   >
   > The PR has been updated. Reviewers will be notified of the new commits.

2. Switch back to the previous branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -
   ```

### What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT create the initial test plan — use `/test-plan.create` for that
- Does NOT create the PR — use `/test-plan.publish` for that
- Does NOT re-run sub-agent analyzers — if feedback requires deeper re-analysis with new source documents, use `/test-plan.update` (planned)
- Does NOT change the PR title, description, or reviewers
- Does NOT blindly apply all feedback — every item is assessed and presented to the user for decision
