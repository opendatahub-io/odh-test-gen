# Test Plan Gap Resolver

Determine which test plan gaps are resolved by new documentation and analyzer findings, and which gaps remain open.

## Invocation

This skill is invoked by `/test-plan.update` as a forked sub-agent. It receives:
1. Old gaps from TestPlanGaps.md
2. New findings from the three analyzers
3. List of new documents added

## Inputs (passed inline in skill arguments)

The parent skill passes:
```
Old Gaps from TestPlanGaps.md:
## Scope & Endpoints
- <gap_1>
- <gap_2>

## Test Strategy & Risks
- <gap_3>

## Environment & Infrastructure
- <gap_4>
- <gap_5>

New Findings from Analyzers:
- Endpoints: <findings_from_test-plan.analyze.endpoints>
- Risks: <findings_from_test-plan.analyze.risks>
- Infrastructure: <findings_from_test-plan.analyze.infra>

New Documents Added:
- <doc_1_name> (e.g., "API Specification v2.0")
- <doc_2_name> (e.g., "Design Document - Catalog Architecture")
```

## Process

### Step 1: Parse Old Gaps

Extract gaps by section:
1. **Scope & Endpoints gaps** - missing API details, unclear scope, undefined endpoints
2. **Test Strategy & Risks gaps** - unclear priorities, missing risk mitigations, incomplete NFR assessments
3. **Environment & Infrastructure gaps** - missing test data specs, unclear dependencies, undefined test users

For each gap, identify what information would resolve it (often stated in the gap itself, e.g., "would be resolved by: API spec").

### Step 2: Analyze New Findings for Gap Resolution

For each old gap, check if new analyzer findings or documents address it:

**Scope & Endpoints gaps:**
- Gap: "Exact endpoint paths not specified"
  - Check if endpoints analyzer now has specific paths (e.g., `POST /api/v2/catalog/items`)
  - If yes → mark as resolved by endpoints analyzer findings
  
- Gap: "Expected response format unclear"
  - Check if new documents include API spec with response schemas
  - If yes → mark as resolved by specific document

**Test Strategy & Risks gaps:**
- Gap: "Priority criteria too generic"
  - Check if risks analyzer now has feature-specific priority definitions
  - If yes → mark as resolved
  
- Gap: "Missing risk mitigation for database failure"
  - Check if risks analyzer identified mitigation strategy
  - If yes → mark as resolved

**Environment & Infrastructure gaps:**
- Gap: "Test data schema not defined"
  - Check if infra analyzer or new docs specify test data requirements
  - If yes → mark as resolved

### Step 3: Identify New Gaps

Check if new analyzer findings revealed new gaps:
- Endpoints analyzer: new APIs without implementation details?
- Risks analyzer: new risks without mitigations?
- Infra analyzer: new dependencies without version specs?

Add these to the unresolved gaps list.

### Step 4: Semantic Matching Logic

Use intelligent matching, not just keyword search:

**Example 1: Endpoint gap**
- Old gap: "Catalog API endpoint paths not specified"
- New finding: "POST /catalog/items, GET /catalog/items/{id}, DELETE /catalog/items/{id}"
- **Match**: Both are about catalog API endpoints → RESOLVED

**Example 2: Test data gap**
- Old gap: "Expected hardware profile name format unclear"
- New finding: "Hardware profiles follow format: hwp-{accelerator}-{memory}-{version} (e.g., hwp-gpu-16g-v1)"
- **Match**: Both are about hardware profile naming → RESOLVED

**Example 3: Partial resolution**
- Old gap: "RBAC roles and permissions not specified"
- New finding: "Three roles: admin, developer, viewer"
- **Partial match**: Roles identified but permissions still missing → PARTIALLY RESOLVED (or keep as gap with note)

**Anti-hallucination**:
- Only mark gaps as resolved if new information truly addresses them
- If unsure → keep gap open (conservative approach)
- Don't invent resolutions

### Step 5: Output Structure

Return structured output for the parent skill:

```markdown
## Resolved Gaps

### Scope & Endpoints
- ✅ Exact endpoint paths not specified → **Resolved by**: API Specification v2.0 (POST /catalog/items, GET /catalog/items/{id}, DELETE /catalog/items/{id})
- ✅ Expected response format unclear → **Resolved by**: API Specification v2.0 (JSON schema provided)

### Test Strategy & Risks
- ✅ Priority criteria too generic → **Resolved by**: Analyzer findings (feature-specific P0: catalog operations affecting user workflows)

### Environment & Infrastructure
- ✅ Test data schema not defined → **Resolved by**: Design Document (catalog items require: id, name, category, tags array)

## Unresolved Gaps

### Scope & Endpoints
- Cypress test scenarios not specified — **Requires**: ADR / test specification
- Unit test file structure unclear — **Requires**: ADR / test specification

### Test Strategy & Risks
(No unresolved gaps in this section)

### Environment & Infrastructure
- Global namespace constant not confirmed (assumed redhat-ods-applications) — **Requires**: ADR / design doc

## New Gaps Identified

### Scope & Endpoints
- New catalog search API endpoints discovered but query parameter validation rules not specified — **Requires**: API spec addendum

### Environment & Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL version requirement not specified (catalog storage dependency) — **Requires**: infrastructure doc

## Statistics

- **Total gaps before**: 10
- **Gaps resolved**: 4
- **Gaps remaining**: 6
- **New gaps identified**: 2
- **Total gaps now**: 8

## Updated Gap Count

Open gaps: 8
Resolved gaps: 4
Status: Open (gaps remaining)
```

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT modify TestPlanGaps.md — returns structured output for parent to apply
- Does NOT re-run analyzers — receives their findings as input
- Does NOT fetch new documents — receives document names as context
- Does NOT make assumptions about what resolves gaps — conservative matching only
