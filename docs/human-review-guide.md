## How Test Plans Enter the Pipeline

A test plan is generated from a Jira strategy (RHAISTRAT) or issue
(RHOAIENG) using `/test-plan-create`. The pipeline:

1. Fetches the strategy from Jira
2. Runs three parallel analyzers (endpoints, risks, infrastructure)
3. Assembles a structured test plan from their findings
4. Identifies gaps where source material was insufficient
5. Scores the plan against a 5-criterion rubric (0-10)
6. Auto-revises if any criterion scores below 2 (max 2 cycles)
7. Stamps verdict labels on the Jira issue

After scoring, test cases are generated with `/test-plan-create-cases`
and the complete artifact set is published to GitHub via
`/test-plan-publish`, which opens a PR for human review.

## Two Paths to Approval

Every test plan that arrives as a PR has already passed through the
automated pipeline. The path forward depends on the rubric verdict:

- **Rubric-pass** (>= 8/10, no zeros) -- The plan meets baseline
  quality. Review for domain accuracy, then approve or request changes.
- **Rubric-fail** (< 7 or any zero) -- The automated review flagged
  significant issues. These need source documents (ADR, API spec,
  design doc) or manual correction before approval.

Both paths conclude with adding the `test-plan-human-reviewed` label
after the reviewer is satisfied.

## Scoring

The automated rubric evaluates every test plan across 5 dimensions,
each scored 0-2.

| Criterion | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Specificity** | Is this plan written for *this* feature, or is it generic boilerplate? |
| **Grounding** | Are technical details traceable to source material, or fabricated? |
| **Scope Fidelity** | Does the plan's scope match the strategy's scope? |
| **Actionability** | Could a QE engineer start testing from this plan alone? |
| **Consistency** | Do sections agree with each other? |

| Verdict | Trigger | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Ready** | total >= 8, no zeros | Baseline quality met -- proceed to review |
| **Revise** | total = 7, no zeros | Minor improvements needed |
| **Rework** | total < 7 or any zero | Significant issues -- needs source docs |

## Setup

1. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
2. Set Jira credentials:
   ```bash
   export JIRA_URL="https://issues.redhat.com"
   export JIRA_USER="your-email@redhat.com"
   export JIRA_TOKEN="your-jira-api-token"
   ```
3. Clone the test plans repository (your fork):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/opendatahub-test-plans \
       ~/Code/opendatahub-test-plans
   ```
4. Install the skill (if reviewing locally):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-test-gen \
       ~/ai/odh-test-gen
   cd ~/ai/odh-test-gen && uv sync --extra dev
   ```

## Workflow

### 1. Open the PR

Find the PR in `opendatahub-io/opendatahub-test-plans`. PRs follow the
naming convention `Test Plan: <feature> (v<version>)` and are created
on branches named `test-plan/<JIRA_KEY>`.

The PR body contains the executive summary, scope, and test objectives
extracted from the test plan.

### 2. Read the artifacts

Each PR contains up to four types of artifact:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `TestPlan.md` | The test plan -- 10 sections covering scope, strategy, environment, endpoints, test cases, NFRs, risks |
| `TestPlanGaps.md` | Known gaps where the AI lacked source material |
| `TestPlanReview.md` | Automated rubric scores with evidence and cross-references |
| `test_cases/TC-*.md` | Individual test case specifications |
| `test_cases/INDEX.md` | Summary index of all test cases by category and priority |

Start with `TestPlanReview.md` to understand what the automated
scorer found. Then read `TestPlanGaps.md` to see what the AI flagged
as unknown. These two files tell you where to focus your review of
`TestPlan.md`.

### 3. Review the test plan

Use the rubric criteria as your review framework. The automated scorer
catches structural issues, but domain expertise is needed for accuracy.

#### Specificity (Section 2, Section 8)

**Smell test**: Take any risk from Section 8 and mentally paste it into
a test plan for a completely different feature. If it still makes sense,
it's generic boilerplate.

What to check:
- Do P0/P1/P2 priority definitions in Section 2.3 reference
  feature-specific scenarios, or are they vague ("critical
  functionality", "core features")?
- Do risks in Section 8 name specific dependencies and failure modes
  unique to this feature?
- Are test levels in Section 2.1 justified by the actual interface
  types under test?

#### Grounding (Section 4)

**Smell test**: For every entry in Section 4 (endpoints/methods under
test), can you point to the exact sentence in the strategy or ADR that
justifies it? If not, it may be fabricated.

What to check:
- Are endpoint paths, method signatures, and version numbers traceable
  to the strategy or ADR?
- Are unknowns marked as TBD (acceptable) rather than filled with
  plausible-sounding but invented details (not acceptable)?
- Does `TestPlanReview.md` contain a grounding cross-reference table?
  Check any entries marked "Suspected Fabrication" or "Extrapolated."

**This is the most important criterion for human review.** The
automated scorer can detect structural fabrication patterns, but only a
domain expert can verify whether a specific endpoint path or API
contract is real.

#### Scope Fidelity (Section 1, Section 4)

**Smell test**: List the strategy's deliverables. For each one, find a
test objective in Section 1.3 that covers it. Any orphans in either
direction indicate misalignment.

What to check:
- Does every in-scope item from the strategy map to at least one test
  objective?
- Are out-of-scope items truly absent from Section 4 endpoints?
- Is there scope creep (testing things the strategy doesn't mention)?

#### Actionability (Section 3, Section 9)

**Smell test**: Hand Sections 3 and 9 to a platform engineer who knows
nothing about the feature. Could they provision the test environment?
If they'd come back with questions, it's not actionable.

What to check:
- Are OpenShift and RHOAI versions specified (or marked TBD with
  rationale)?
- Does test data include format and examples, not just "sample data"?
- Are test users defined with specific roles and permissions?
- Are infrastructure requirements concrete enough to act on?

#### Consistency (cross-section)

Run these six cross-checks:
1. Section 4 endpoints are a subset of Section 1.2 scope
2. Section 2.1 test levels match interface types in Section 4
3. Priority assignments in Section 4 match Section 2.3 definitions
4. Section 10.2 lists every endpoint from Section 4
5. Section 7 NFR categories are consistent with feature scope (e.g.,
   a feature that pulls images should not mark Disconnected as N/A)
6. Section 6.2 E2E Coverage Matrix includes all P0 endpoints (if test
   cases have been generated)

### 4. Review test cases

If test cases (`test_cases/TC-*.md`) are included in the PR, review
them for:

#### Structure and completeness

- Does each TC have a clear **Objective** (one sentence)?
- Are **Test Steps** actionable and specific, not vague ("verify it
  works")?
- Are **Expected Results** observable facts that can be verified without
  subjective judgment?
- Is **Test Data** included where the test requires specific requests,
  payloads, or configurations?
- Are **Preconditions** listed only when there are specific requirements
  beyond the default test environment?

#### Coverage

- Does the test case set cover all endpoints/methods from Section 4?
- Are P0 endpoints covered by at least one test case?
- Is there a mix of positive, negative, and boundary test cases?
- Do E2E test cases (TC-E2E-*) cover the user journeys described in
  the strategy?

#### Priority alignment

- Do test case priorities match the priority definitions in Section 2.3?
- Are the most critical user paths covered by P0 test cases?

#### Naming and organization

- Do test case IDs follow the `TC-<CATEGORY>-<NUMBER>` convention?
- Does `INDEX.md` accurately reflect the full set of test cases?
- Are categories consistent with Section 5.2 naming conventions?

### 5. Provide feedback

**Option A -- PR comments (recommended for team review)**

Leave inline comments on the PR. The test plan author can then use
`/test-plan-resolve-feedback <PR_URL>` to process your comments:

1. The skill reads all review comments from the PR
2. It assesses each comment against the test plan
3. The author decides which to apply (with your assessment as context)
4. Accepted changes are committed and pushed to the same branch
5. The version is bumped (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)

This is the preferred workflow because it preserves review history in
the PR and lets the author triage feedback with AI assistance.

**Option B -- Score only (standalone quality check)**

Run `/test-plan-score <feature_dir>` to get a rubric score without
modifying the plan. Useful for evaluating test plans created outside
the automated pipeline or for a quick quality check.

**Option C -- Direct editing**

For minor corrections (typos, version numbers you know), edit the files
directly and push. For significant changes, prefer Option A so the
changes are documented.

### 6. Approve

Once satisfied:

1. Approve the PR on GitHub
2. Add the `test-plan-human-reviewed` label to the source Jira issue
3. Merge the PR

The test plan is now the basis for test automation via
`/test-plan-case-implement`.

## What to Focus On (By Role)

### QE Engineer (feature owner)

You know the feature best. Focus on:
- **Grounding** -- Are the endpoints and API contracts real? Are
  versions correct?
- **Completeness** -- Are there test scenarios the AI missed that you
  know are important?
- **Environment** -- Can you actually set up the test environment from
  Sections 3 and 9?
- **Test cases** -- Are the test steps ones you could actually execute?

### Team Lead

Focus on:
- **Scope fidelity** -- Does the test plan match what was agreed in the
  strategy?
- **Priority alignment** -- Are the right things marked P0?
- **NFRs** -- Are disconnected, upgrade, performance, and RBAC
  considerations properly addressed or explicitly marked N/A with
  justification?
- **Gaps** -- Are the gaps in `TestPlanGaps.md` blockers, or can
  testing proceed?

### Domain Expert / Architect

Focus on:
- **Grounding** -- Verify technical details against your knowledge of
  the component
- **Risks** -- Are the identified risks real? Are there risks the AI
  missed?
- **Architecture alignment** -- Does the test approach align with the
  component's architecture and integration points?

## Common Issues and How to Fix Them

| Issue | Where to Look | Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Generic priority definitions | Section 2.3 | PR comment: "P0 should reference [specific scenario]" |
| Fabricated endpoint paths | Section 4, TestPlanReview.md grounding table | PR comment with correct paths, or provide ADR |
| Missing test scenarios | Section 4, test_cases/ | PR comment describing the missing scenario |
| Vague environment setup | Sections 3, 9 | PR comment with specific versions and config |
| Scope creep (testing out-of-scope items) | Section 1.2 vs Section 4 | PR comment identifying out-of-scope entries |
| NFR marked N/A incorrectly | Section 7 | PR comment explaining why the category applies |
| TBDs that you can resolve | TestPlanGaps.md | PR comment with the answer, or provide the source doc |
| Inconsistent cross-references | Section 10.2 vs Section 4 | PR comment (often auto-fixed by the pipeline) |
| Missing E2E coverage for P0 endpoints | Section 6.2 | PR comment requesting E2E test cases |

## Key Rules

1. **Review the review first.** Start with `TestPlanReview.md` and
   `TestPlanGaps.md` -- they tell you where the AI struggled.
2. **Grounding is your top priority.** The AI can structure a plan, but
   only you know if the technical details are real.
3. **Use PR comments for feedback.** `/test-plan-resolve-feedback`
   turns your comments into tracked, versioned changes.
4. **Resolve TBDs with source documents.** If you can provide an ADR,
   API spec, or design doc, the author can re-run analyzers to fill
   gaps automatically.
5. **Don't fix what the pipeline can fix.** Consistency issues
   (mismatched tables, missing cross-references) are often handled by
   auto-revision. Focus your review on domain accuracy.
6. **Check fabrication carefully.** A plausible-sounding endpoint
   path that doesn't exist is worse than a TBD, because downstream
   test cases will be built on it.
