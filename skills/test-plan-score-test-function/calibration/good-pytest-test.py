# SCORER CALIBRATION: HIGH QUALITY test (should score 9-10/10)
#
# Purpose: Trains scorer to recognize excellent pytest test quality.
#          Tiger Team has no pytest rules yet - this calibration is standalone.
#
# Rubric Scores (5 criteria, 0-2 each, total 10):
# ✅ Coverage: 2/2 - All preconditions, steps, expected results implemented
# ✅ Assertions: 2/2 - Specific assertions with messages, checks exact values
# ✅ Conventions: 2/2 - Follows pytest patterns, uses actual repo markers
# ✅ Test Data: 2/2 - Uses exact model ID from TC Expected Response
# ✅ Code Quality: 2/2 - No TODOs for specified requirements, clean implementation
#
# This example demonstrates QUALITY LEVEL (9/10), not just patterns.
# NOTE: Markers shown are examples - actual test should use markers from conventions file
