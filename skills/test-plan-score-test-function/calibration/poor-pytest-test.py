# SCORER CALIBRATION: LOW QUALITY test (should score 3-4/10)
#
# Issues demonstrated (compare with good-pytest-test.py for correct version):
# ❌ Coverage: 1/2 - Missing some expected results, has TODOs for specified requirements
# ❌ Assertions: 0/2 - Generic assertions, no messages
# ❌ Conventions: 1/2 - Uses invented marker not in repo's pytest.ini
# ❌ Test Data: 0/2 - Uses placeholder "test-model" instead of exact ID from TC
# ❌ Code Quality: 0/2 - Excessive TODOs for things specified in TC, fabricated helper
#
# Tiger Team has no pytest rules yet - this calibration is standalone.
