# Calibration Example 1: kagenti_agent_templates/TestPlan.md

**Source**: `kagenti_agent_templates/TestPlan.md` (RHAISTRAT-1290)
**Test plan version**: With test cases generated (36 TCs, Sections 5/10 populated)
**Note**: This example predates Section 6 (E2E Scenarios) and Section 7 (NFR Assessment). It demonstrates the original four-cross-check consistency model. Modern test plans should evaluate six cross-checks (adding NFR and E2E coverage).

## Score Table

| Criterion | Score | Evidence | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Specificity | 2 | P0 definition names kagenti OCI labels, agentRuntime CR rejection, AgentCard discovery failure. Risks name kagenti runtime, GenAI Studio export format, well-known.json schema evolution. | Swap test: "kagenti runtime availability" cannot be pasted into a test plan for a database migration feature. Priority definitions describe deployment-specific failure scenarios, not generic "core functionality" language. |
| Grounding | 1 | Section 4 entries (well-known.json, agentRuntime CR, OCI labels, evaluate.py, MLflow) match strategy themes. However, specific endpoint paths are not in the strategy — "well-known.json" is inferred from the concept of AgentCard serving rather than an explicit API path. MLflow version "2.x" is assumed, not sourced. | Mostly grounded but some extrapolation. The strategy describes the *concepts* (AgentCard, OCI labels, evaluation) but not specific REST paths or tool versions. These are reasonable inferences rather than fabrications, but they are not traceable to a specific sentence. |
| Scope Fidelity | 2 | Every in-scope item maps to at least one test objective. Out-of-scope items (kagenti operator internals, model server runtime, GenAI Studio non-export features) are absent from Section 4. No scope creep. | Strategy deliverables: OCI labels (Obj 1), well-known.json (Obj 2), agentRuntime CR (Obj 3), model server config (Obj 4), evaluation stubs (Obj 5-6), end-to-end lifecycle (Obj 7). All covered. |
| Actionability | 1 | Specific tools named (podman 4.x+, oc 4.16+, MLflow 2.x, Python 3.11+). Test users have personas with named roles (Alex=developer, Paula=platform engineer). However: OpenShift version is "4.16+" (range, not pinned), RHOAI version not specified, "latest stable release as of test execution" is vague, model server is "TBD", GenAI Studio access "permissions TBD". | A platform engineer could start provisioning but would ask: "Which exact RHOAI version?", "Which model server?", "What are GenAI Studio permissions?" The TBDs are acknowledged but not marked with what document would resolve them. |
| Consistency | 2 | Section 4 has 7 entries; Section 9.2 lists all 7 with mapped test cases. Test levels (Functional, Integration, E2E, Compliance, API) match the interface types in Section 4 (Config, REST, Method, UI). Priority assignments in Section 4 match the definitions in Section 2.3 (P0 = deployment/discovery blockers, P1 = workflow blockers). | All four cross-checks pass (six in modern rubric, but this plan predates Section 6/7). No orphan endpoints, no mismatched priorities. |

**Total: 8/10 — Verdict: Ready**

## Key Observations

- This is a well-structured test plan with strong specificity and scope fidelity
- The main weakness is grounding: several technical details are reasonable inferences rather than verbatim strategy content
- Actionability loses a point for multiple "TBD" items without resolution paths
- The test plan was generated with test cases already populated, which strengthens the consistency score (Section 9.2 has mapped TCs)
